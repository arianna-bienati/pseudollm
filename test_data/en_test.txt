Subject: Application for test administrator position in the KOLIPSI 3 project

Dear Dr. Colombo,

I am writing to express my interest in the occasional work position as a test administrator in schools for the KOLIPSI 3 project at the Institute of Applied Linguistics.

I am currently a third-year student in Communication Sciences at the University of Trento, with solid proficiency in both Italian and German (C1 level in both languages). My education has provided me with excellent communication skills and a natural aptitude for working with young people.

I have gained significant experience in the field of education and research, having worked as a language tutor at my university's Language Center and provided support in interdisciplinary research projects. I hold a driver's license and own a car, which will allow me to travel easily between school institutions in the Province of Bolzano.

My motivation for this position stems from my deep interest in linguistic research and my desire to contribute to a project that investigates the dynamics of language learning in a bilingual context such as South Tyrol. I believe I possess the required personal characteristics: reliability, precision, and the ability to relate effectively with students and school staff.

I am available to participate in the preparatory meeting and am immediately available for any interviews or further information.

I am attaching my curriculum vitae and look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Marco Rossi
